    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>I am from Clovis, New Mexico. I have always had a desire to learn new things and see different places.
        After living in the Marshall Islands for eight months, I've recently moved to Cary, North Carolina.
        As a Cosmetologist for over 10 years and since moving to Cary, I have started an exciting journey towards a new career path in Web Development. 
        A career in Web Development intrigues me with the everyday opportunity of growth, mental stimulation and the ability to continue channeling my creativity.
